## Problem statement
AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. The company plans to expand into other metro and tier-1 cities within the next two years.

Recently, AtliQ Mart has encountered issues with some key customers not renewing their annual contracts due to service-related problems. The speculation is that some critical products were either delivered late or not delivered in full consistently, leading to poor customer service. To address this problem before expanding, the management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with monitoring the 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers daily, ensuring they can quickly address any issues.

The Supply Chain team has decided to implement a standard approach for measuring service levels. They will track the 'On-Time Delivery (OT) %', 'In-Full Delivery (IF) %', and 'On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %' of customer orders daily, comparing these metrics against the target service levels set for each customer.
